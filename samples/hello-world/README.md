# Hello World!

This sample application demonstrates how Containerless transparently
transitions from container-based isolation to language-based isolation.
`helloWorld.js` contains a basic example of what a function with Containerless
looks like. `containerless.listen(...)` starts a web server that listens for
incoming requests, and `containerless.hello()` sends a response that indicates
if the function is currently using container-based isolation
(`"Hello from JavaScript~"`) or language-based isolation (`"Hello from Rust!"`).
